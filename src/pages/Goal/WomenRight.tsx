            where girls and women have an equal opportunity to succeed and shine

            in poor and developing countries face discrimination; violence and
            human trafficking that threaten their lives and eliminate their
            potential. We are working with women and girls with all ages so that
            they can change their future and uplift entire community. Having the
            right investment for their safety, health, education, economic
            wellbeing they can change the whole world.
