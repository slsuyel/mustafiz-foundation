            Vulnerable people in our community don’t have control over important
            choices that affect their lives. They don’t have place to live, lack
            of knowledge and resource of healthy life style, lack of education
            to improve their lives and to make a right decision .Particularly
            Women & Girls struggle to advocate for their lives and make their
            voice heard. MFI helps those vulnerable people to empower & improve
            their lives for a better future. Besides strategic planned work we
            offer food, clothing, shelter and financial support for treatment
            and education for the orphan or poor who have been passing miserable
            life for financial hardship or lack of guardianship and better
            education. We also help vulnerable people like elderly people,
            people with disabilities or families facing crisis for treatment,
            Educational needs, shelter, or food. We are standing and will stand
            with elderly people and people with disabilities whenever they need.
            This is the right path as we believe and we strive to empower our
            society and communities so that every individual can participate to
            empower the nation and ultimately the world.
